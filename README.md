First inital project on The Odin Project (TOP) starting on the 4/12/20. 
This README.md is to document stage by stage where I'm at, what problems I run into and how I overcame them (Without just coping and pasting from Chrome Dev tools to my own code)
It's going to be a long journey ahead, with a lot of challenges but what comes easy won't last, and what lasts won't come easy! 
At 1700 4/12/20, I got most of the HTML done that I wanted. Added the Google Logo, a search bar, button ready for the Microphone, and all the relative links on the homepage. 
Next step is to add the Google Search and I'm feeling lucky! buttons, then start styling using CSS. 
I think the more of these projects I do, the easier it will come. Doing FCC inbetween Odin was more of a hinderance than it was a help, as I'd forgotten all about terminal and basic HTML as it seemed to focus more on the CSS side of life. Hopefully that helps at the next stage!
