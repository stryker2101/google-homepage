First inital project on The Odin Project (TOP) starting on the 4/12/20. 
This README.md is to document stage by stage where I'm at, what problems I run into and how I overcame them (Without just coping and pasting from Chrome Dev tools to my own code)
It's going to be a long journey ahead, with a lot of challenges but what comes easy won't last, and what lasts won't come easy! 

At 1700 4/12/20, I got most of the HTML done that I wanted. Added the Google Logo, a search bar, button ready for the Microphone, and all the relative links on the homepage. 
Next step is to add the Google Search and I'm feeling lucky! buttons, then start styling using CSS. 
I think the more of these projects I do, the easier it will come. Doing FCC inbetween Odin was more of a hinderance than it was a help, as I'd forgotten all about terminal and basic HTML as it seemed to focus more on the CSS side of life. Hopefully that helps at the next stage! 

05/12/20 - Start with adding the Google search and I'm feeling lucky buttons which should be straight forward enough given I added a button yesterday. Once done, move on to start a CSS sheet to start stylising the Google Homepage.

Changed the HTML of the "Search by Voice" button to match that of the "Google Search" & "I'm Feeling Lucky!" button. All elements of the homepage for HTML are now in, just to start CSS.

05/12/20 @ 12:48 - Got everything except the "Google Search" and "I'm feeling Lucky!" buttons in position with CSS. A lot to take in, with lot's of googling, dev tools and others codes to try and figure where I was going wrong. It's slowly coming together though.

08/12/20 - Removed the button for the account link, as apparently it's JS that links a button to a different website or page. Turned account back to a li with the correct class and removed the account class completely. Think it's finished. 

Overall, the project is a brilliant way to start a journey into web dev. I cheated myself by "peaking" at others code, but before using it, googled on why that person used that to get an understanding of it. I think when I'm alot more comfortable I will return to this project to see what I'd do different compared to how I've done it now.
